This example shows how eventfd(2) file descriptors can be shared
over Unix sockets by processes which have no common ancestor.

This problem appears frequently if one needs a poll(2) compatible
notification mechanism; for instance when using queues in shared memory,
to signal the reader that data is available.

Usage:

make
run evserver in one window
run evclient in another window


This code uses the libancil library: http://www.normalesup.org/~george/comp/libancillary/
